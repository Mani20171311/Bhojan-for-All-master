Food waste management is the systematic approach to handling and repurposing food waste to mitigate its environmental impact and maximize resource efficiency. It involves strategies aimed at prevention, reduction, recovery, and recycling of food waste at various stages of the food supply chain. Prevention measures focus on minimizing waste generation through better inventory management and consumer education. Reduction efforts seek to minimize waste through donation programs and improved storage practices. Recovery initiatives divert food waste from landfills, with options including composting and anaerobic digestion. Recycling involves transforming food waste into new products or materials, such as biofuels or animal feed. By implementing effective food waste management strategies, societies can reduce environmental degradation, conserve resources, and address food insecurity while promoting a more sustainable and circular economy.

## Problem statement 
Food wastage: Hotels, restaurants, and households often discard excess food, contributing to environmental waste.
Food insecurity: Many individuals, particularly those in poverty, struggle to access an adequate and nutritious diet due to financial constraints.
Severity of the problem:

Food wastage not only leads to environmental degradation but also highlights inefficiencies in the food distribution system.
Food insecurity results in malnutrition and health issues among vulnerable populations, exacerbating societal inequalities.
Why we need a solution:

Redistributing surplus food to those in need reduces wastage, addresses food insecurity, and promotes sustainability.
Efficient food redistribution channels can bridge the gap between surplus food and disadvantaged communities, ensuring equitable access to nutrition.
Group of people affected:

Low-income individuals and families who lack the financial means to afford sufficient food are most affected by both food wastage and insecurity.## About the project
mention few details and features of the project , how it is solving the problem 

## About the project
The app serves as a platform connecting food donors (hotels, restaurants, households) with organizations and individuals in need.
It allows donors to upload information about surplus food items, including quantity, type, and expiration date.
Recipient organizations and individuals can browse available donations based on their location and food preferences.
The app facilitates communication between donors and recipients, allowing for seamless coordination of food pickups and deliveries.
It may include features for tracking donations, generating reports, and providing feedback to users.
Features of the Project:

User Profiles: Donors and recipients can create profiles with relevant information such as location, preferences, and contact details.
Donation Listings: Donors can list surplus food items with details such as quantity, type, and expiration date, making it easy for recipients to find suitable donations.
Search and Filter: Recipients can search for donations based on location, type of food, and availability, streamlining the process of finding relevant donations.
Real-Time Notifications: Both donors and recipients receive notifications about new donations, messages, and pickup/delivery requests, ensuring timely communication.
Pickup/Delivery Coordination: The app provides tools for scheduling and coordinating food pickups or deliveries between donors and recipients, optimizing logistics.
Feedback and Ratings: Users can provide feedback and ratings based on their experience with donations and interactions, fostering trust and accountability within the community.
Analytics and Reporting: The app may offer analytics and reporting features for tracking donation trends, food distribution impact, and user engagement, enabling continuous improvement and transparency.
How It Solves the Problem:

Efficient Redistribution: By providing a centralized platform for donating and receiving food, the app streamlines the process and reduces barriers to food redistribution.
Minimized Food Waste: Surplus food from hotels, restaurants, and households can be efficiently redirected to those in need, minimizing wastage and promoting sustainability.
Increased Access to Food: Individuals and families facing food insecurity gain access to nutritious meals that would otherwise go to waste, addressing the root cause of hunger.
Community Engagement: The app fosters community engagement and collaboration by connecting donors, recipients, and organizations, creating a network of support for vulnerable populations.
Data-Driven Solutions: Analytics and reporting features enable stakeholders to track donation impact, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions to optimize food distribution efforts

## Technical implemntaion 
Flowchart: Start → User Registration → Profile Creation → End
Utilize flowcharts to illustrate the process of users registering on the app and creating their profiles. This would include steps such as providing basic information, preferences, and contact details.
Donation Listing and Matching:

Flowchart: Start → Donor Listing → Recipient Matching → End
Show how donors list surplus food items and how recipients are matched with suitable donations based on criteria such as location, food preferences, and availability.
Communication and Coordination:

Flowchart: Start → Communication → Pickup/Delivery Coordination → End
Illustrate the communication process between donors and recipients, including messaging features and tools for scheduling pickups or deliveries.
